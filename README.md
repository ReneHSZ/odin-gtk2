# odin-gtk2
GTK+2 bindings for the Odin programming language. Currently incomplete, PRs welcome!

You have to install the GTK+2 library for it to be linked with.
This is tested under Ubuntu 17.10, it should work under any other Linux distribution though.
It should mostly work on Windows without major modifications as well, however it is currently untested.

## Installing
Make sure to install the development package of gtk+-2.0. This process may be different between operating system distributions.
Then, just clone this library into your shared collection in the Odin installation folder.

## License
MIT license, see [LICENSE](LICENSE) file.
