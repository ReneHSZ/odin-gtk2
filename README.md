# odin-gtk2
GTK+2 bindings for the Odin programming language. Currently incomplete, PRs welcome!

You have to install the GTK+2 library for it to be linked with.
This is tested under Ubuntu 17.10, it should work under any other Linux distribution though.
It should mostly work on Windows without major modifications as well, however it is currently untested.
